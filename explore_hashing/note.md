this is a good explanation of hashing and buckets

We have fixed buckets and multiple items get the same hash value .ie. belong to same buckets. This makes search faster etc.  
"If you take the mod of any number, you get the bucket to look into, and thus have to search through less results than if you just searched initially, since each bucket has less results in it than the whole set of inputs."

also explained using a phone book - hash function is first letter and look into index ; day seraching For Donald Duck; you straight away
start from D in the book index and see which pages mention Donald Duck
